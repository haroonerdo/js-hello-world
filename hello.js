/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Hello World 2: Electric Boolagoo!");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:*/
// 1. Change the message that is printed.
console.log("Welcome to the LaunchCode!");
// 2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
//console.log"Hello World!";
// 3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
//console.log(Hello World!);
// 4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
//console.log("Hello World!")
// 5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
console.log("1");
console.log("13");
// 6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to the LaunchCode!");
// 7. Print two messages on the same line.
console.log("Hello World! Welcome to the LaunchCode!");
// 8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
console.log("Hello World! \"Welcome to the LaunchCode!\"");
//9. Other. You choose!
console.log("\nHello World! \n\"Welcome to the LaunchCode!\" ");
